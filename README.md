#PowerShell Backup Script

A little script I made to have my backups done in a easy way with no need of installing any program. It is a good script to have in your pendrive and backup from multiple computers.

##Getting started

- Move Backup.ps1 to the folder you want to place your backup.
- Edit Backup.ps1. Set values in `$Roots` dictionary corresponding to your computer`s name, and the folders in it that you want to backup
- Run Backup.ps1.
- When you have your backup up to date, just run Backup.ps1 again.

##Restoring Backup

I still need to work on this, but if you take a look at the file structure created, you will be able to restore it manually, it is not fancy at all.
